# Diabetes

```
Diabetes is a chronic (long-lasting) health condition that affects how your body turns food into energy.
Your body breaks down most of the food you eat into sugar (glucose) and releases it into your bloodstream. When your blood sugar goes up, it signals your pancreas to release insulin. Insulin acts like a key to let the blood sugar into your body’s cells for use as energy.


Type 1 Diabetes:
This reaction stops your body from making insulin. Approximately 5-10% of the people who have diabetes have type 1. Symptoms of type 1 diabetes often develop quickly. It’s usually diagnosed in children, teens, and young adults. If you have type 1 diabetes, you’ll need to take insulin every day to survive. Currently, no one knows how to prevent type 1 diabetes.


Type 2 Diabetes:
With type 2 diabetes, your body doesn’t use insulin well and can’t keep blood sugar at normal levels. About 90-95% of people with diabetes have type 2. It develops over many years and is usually diagnosed in adults (but more and more in children, teens, and young adults). 


Gestational Diabetes:
Gestational diabetes develops in pregnant women who have never had diabetes. If you have gestational diabetes, your baby could be at higher risk for health problems. Gestational diabetes usually goes away after your baby is born. However, it increases your risk for type 2 diabetes later in life. Your baby is more likely to have obesity as a child or teen and develop type 2 diabetes later in life.


fasting blood sugar : Normal range (70 to 100 milligrams)
post meal blood sugar : Normal range (Less than 140 mg/dL)
Random Blood Glucose : Normal range (Less than 200 mg/dL)

# Blood Pressure

```
When the heart pumps blood through the arteries, the bloods put pressure on the artery walls.

Blood pressure is measured using two numbers:
The first number, called systolic blood pressure, measures the pressure in your arteries when your heart beats.
The second number, called diastolic blood pressure, measures the pressure in your arteries when your heart rests between beats.

If the measurement reads 120 systolic and 80 diastolic, you would say, “120 over 80,” or write, “120/80 mmHg.”

A normal blood pressure level is less than 120/80 mmHg


High blood pressure, also called hypertension, is blood pressure that is higher than normal. Your blood pressure changes throughout the day based on your activities.

# Thyroid

```
As an endocrine gland, your thyroid makes and secretes hormones. Your thyroid produces and releases the following hormones:


Thyroxine (T4): This is the primary hormone your thyroid makes and releases. Although your thyroid makes the most of this hormone, it doesn’t have much of an effect on your metabolism. Once your thyroid releases T4 into your bloodstream, it can convert to T3 through a process called deiodination.

Triiodothyronine (T3): Your thyroid produces lesser amounts of T3 than T4, but it has a much greater effect on your metabolism than T4.

Reverse triiodothyronine (RT3): Your thyroid makes very small amounts of RT3, which reverses the effects of T3.

Calcitonin: This hormone helps regulate the amount of calcium in your blood.


In order to make thyroid hormones, your thyroid gland needs iodine, an element found in food (most commonly, iodized table salt) and water. Your thyroid gland traps iodine and transforms it into thyroid hormones. If you have too little or too much iodine in your body, it can affect the level of hormones your thyroid makes and releases.

Your thyroid hormones affect the following bodily functions:
1. How your body uses energy (metabolism).
2. Heart rate.
3. Breathing.
4. Digestion.
5. Body temperature.
6. Brain development.
7. Mental activity.
8. Skin and bone maintenance.
9. Fertility.

The four main conditions that affect your thyroid include:
1. Hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid).
2. Hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid).
3. Goiter (enlarged thyroid).
4. Thyroid cancer.


Hypothyroidism: Hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid) happens when your thyroid doesn’t produce and release enough thyroid hormones. Happen because of Iodine deficiency. 

Hyperthyroidism: Hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid) happens when your thyroid produces and releases more thyroid hormones than your body needs. Happen because of Iodine Excess.

The first-line test for checking the health of your thyroid is a blood test that measures your levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). It’s a screening test for both hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism.

In general, the normal range for a TSH blood test is 0.5 to 5.0 mIU/L

Your provider can also check the levels of T4 and T3 (thyroid hormones) in your blood.

# Tuberculosis

```
Tuberculosis (TB) is a disease caused by germs that are spread from person to person through the air. TB usually affects the lungs, but it can also affect other parts of the body, such as the brain, the kidneys, or the spine. A person with TB can die if they do not get treatment.

Tuberculosis is preventable and curable.

What Are the Symptoms of TB?
1. Primary TB infection: The immune system may completely destroy the germs. But some captured germs may still survive and multiply.
Most people don't have symptoms during a primary infection. Some people may get flu-like symptoms, such as:
Low fever.
Tiredness.
Cough.

2. Latent TB infection: Immune system cells build a wall around lung tissue with TB germs. The germs can't do any more harm if the immune system keeps them under control. But the germs survive. There are no symptoms during latent TB infection.

3. Active TB disease: Active TB disease happens when the immune system can't control an infection. Germs cause disease throughout the lungs or other parts of the body. Active TB disease may happen right after primary infection. But it usually happens after months or years of latent TB infection.

Symptoms of active TB disease in the lungs usually begin gradually and worsen over a few weeks. They may include:
Cough.
Coughing up blood or mucus.
Chest pain.
Pain with breathing or coughing.
Fever.
Chills.
Night sweats.
Weight loss.
Not wanting to eat.
Tiredness.
Not feeling well in general.

Causes?
Tuberculosis is caused by a bacterium called Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
People with active TB disease in the lungs or voice box can spread the disease. They release tiny droplets that carry the bacteria through the air. This can happen when they're speaking, singing, laughing, coughing or sneezing. A person can get an infection after inhaling the droplets.


Prevention:
1. Seek medical attention if you have symptoms like prolonged cough, fever and unexplained weight loss as early treatment for TB can help stop the spread of disease and improve your chances of recovery.
2. Get tested for TB infection if you are at increased risk, such as if you have HIV or are in contact with people who have TB in your household or your workplace. 
3. If prescribed treatment to prevent TB, complete the full course. 
4. If you have TB, practice good hygiene when coughing, including avoiding contact with other people and wearing a mask, covering your mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing, and disposing of sputum and used tissues properly.


Treatment:
Tuberculosis disease is treated with antibiotics. Treatment is recommended for both TB infection and disease.

The most common antibiotics used are:

1. isoniazid
2. rifampin
3. pyrazinamide
4. ethambutol
5. streptomycin.
To be effective, these medications need to be taken daily for 4–6 months. It is dangerous to stop the medications early or without medical advice. This can allow TB that is still alive to become resistant to the drugs.

Tuberculosis that doesn’t respond to standard drugs is called drug-resistant TB and requires more toxic treatment with different medicines.

# Diarrhea
```
Diarrhea is very common, happening in most people a few times each year. When you have diarrhea, your stool will be loose and watery. In most cases, the cause is unknown and it goes away on its own after a few days. Diarrhea can be caused by bacteria. Dehydration is a dangerous side effect of diarrhea.
```

# Typhoid

```
Typhoid fever is a life-threatening infection caused by the bacterium Salmonella Typhi. It is usually spread through contaminated food or water.
It causes a high fever, flu-like symptoms and diarrhea. You can be contagious with typhoid even if you don’t feel sick. Typhoid can be life-threatening and should be treated promptly with antibiotics. If you live in or travel to an area where typhoid is common, you should get vaccinated.
It infects your small intestines (gut) and causes high fever, stomach pain and other symptoms. Typhoid fever is also called enteric fever.


What are the symptoms of typhoid fever?
Typhoid fever gets its name from a high fever that can last for weeks if left untreated. It often gets progressively worse over a few days.

Other symptoms of typhoid fever include:

Headache.
Chills.
Loss of appetite.
Stomach (abdominal) pain.
“Rose spots” rash, or faint pink spots, usually on your chest or stomach.
Cough.
Muscle aches.
Nausea, vomiting.
Diarrhea or constipation.

# HIV

```
Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is an infection that attacks the body’s immune system. Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is the most advanced stage of the disease.
HIV targets the body’s white blood cells, weakening the immune system.
HIV is spread from the body fluids of an infected person, including blood, breast milk, semen and vaginal fluids. It is not spread by kisses, hugs or sharing food. It can also spread from a mother to her baby.
HIV can be treated and prevented with anti-retroviral therapy (ART). Untreated HIV can progress to AIDS, often after many years.


Signs and symptoms:
The disease spreads more easily in the first few months after a person is infected, but many are unaware of their status until the later stages. In the first few weeks after being infected people may not experience symptoms. Others may have an influenza-like illness including:
1. fever
2. headache
3. rash
4. sore throat.

The infection progressively weakens the immune system. This can cause other signs and symptoms:

1. swollen lymph nodes
2. weight loss
3. fever
4. diarrhoea
5. cough.

Without treatment, people with HIV infection can also develop severe illnesses:

1. tuberculosis (TB)
2. cryptococcal meningitis
3. severe bacterial infections
4. cancers such as lymphomas and Kaposi's sarcoma.

Treatment:
There is no cure for HIV infection. It is treated with antiretroviral drugs, which stop the virus from replicating in the body.
Current antiretroviral therapy (ART) does not cure HIV infection but allows a person’s immune system to get stronger. This helps them to fight other infections.
Currently, ART must be taken every day for the rest of a person’s life.

# Hepatitis
```
Hepatitis is an inflammation of the liver. 
Hepatitis viruses are the most common cause of hepatitis in the world but other infections, toxic substances (e.g. alcohol, certain drugs), and autoimmune diseases can also cause hepatitis.
There are 5 main hepatitis viruses, referred to as types A, B, C, D and E.
In particular, types B and C lead to chronic disease in hundreds of millions of people and, together, are the most common cause of liver cirrhosis and cancer.

Hepatitis A and E are typically caused by ingestion of contaminated food or water.
Hepatitis B, C and D usually occur as a result of parenteral contact with infected body fluids


Scientists have identified 5 unique hepatitis viruses, identified by the letters A, B, C, D, and E. While all cause liver disease, they vary in important ways.


Hepatitis A/E virus (HAV) is present in the faeces of infected persons and is most often transmitted through consumption of contaminated water or food. Certain sex practices can also spread HAV. Infections are in many cases mild, with most people making a full recovery and remaining immune from further HAV infections. However, HAV infections can also be severe and life threatening. Most people in areas of the world with poor sanitation have been infected with this virus. Safe and effective vaccines are available to prevent HAV.

Hepatitis B,C & E virus (HBV) is transmitted through exposure to infective blood, semen, and other body fluids. HBV can be transmitted from infected mothers to infants at the time of birth or from family member to infant in early childhood. Transmission may also occur through transfusions of HBV-contaminated blood and blood products, contaminated injections during medical procedures, and through injection drug use. HBV also poses a risk to healthcare workers who sustain accidental needle stick injuries while caring for infected-HBV patients. Safe and effective vaccines are available to prevent HBV.

IMP POINTS TO NOTE :
```
Rehydration: with oral rehydration salts (ORS) solution. ORS is a mixture of clean water, salt and sugar. It costs a few cents per treatment. ORS is absorbed in the small intestine and replaces the water and electrolytes lost in the faeces.
